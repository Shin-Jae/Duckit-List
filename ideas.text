DAY1:
some themes that we were thinking out
1. digital entertainment
2. sports
3. food
4. current events
5. places to visit/travel
6. outdoor activities

we are leaning towards the bucket list and cloning the task list theme found in "remember the milk"
we can have it to where people can type in things that they want to do or things that they want to achieve
